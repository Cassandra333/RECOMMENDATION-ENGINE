# RECOMMENDATION-ENGINE
Recommendation Engine
#This is my recommendation engine for a subset of a dataset extracted from dice.com.
#I performed data analysis, visualization and modeled the data using three different algorithms to make comparisons to pick one that performed best. 
#I then tried to find one that suits most to the user using cosine similarity/euclidean distance.
#Finally displayed my recommendations for jobs using the input skills.
